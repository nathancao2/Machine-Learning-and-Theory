# Introduction
In this rapidly developing world, many people want to learn machine learning, whether it's because they can appreciate ML's significance in shaping the future, or because they want a lucrative career. I'm no different. As an aspiring computer scientist, I machine learning concepts are very exciting. This repository is filled with facts and guides about machine learning. Come with me; let's learn together! 

# Overview
## Introduction
When I first began learning about machine learning I didn't really know anything about it. I was the average person who thought AI was cool. This part of my repossitory aims to inform someone who doesn't know anything about machine learning, but wishes to get started. 

## What is machine learning? 
The formal definition of machine learning is "the development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without explicit instructions." ML is a way for data scientists and machine learning engineers to better optimize processes and process data more efficiently. It is also a way for entrepreneurs to analyze the sucess of their companies. It is also a way for an engineer to make self-driving cars a reality. 

## Types of machine learning
1. Supervised learning 

In supervised learning, computers are taught by example, meaning I feed a machine with a list of their inputs and their corresponding outputs. An example would be giving a machine a bunch of pictures, and telling it which ones are cats and which ones of dogs. From analyzing these correct examples, the computer learns how to differentiate between a cat and a dog. Popular supervised learning algorithms include regression, classification, and forecasting. Regression computes a prediction out of infinitely many possible outputs, while with classification algorithms there are only a few possible outputs (like the cat/dog differentation problem above). Forecasting makes preductions about possible future outcomes based on past data. 

2. Unsupervised learning 

Unsupervised learning is a process where computers learn about identify patterns or orders among data, under the condition that no human instruction has been provided. One common application of unsupervised learning is how a search engine finds desired search results. If I type in my browser the word "badminton," I can guaratee you tons of pictures and articles about badminton will show up. That's because the search engine was trained to find a common pattern in every resource in it's database that has the strongest correlation with my search. The first articles that show up will most likely have the word "badminton" in it more. There are two popuular algorithms that uses unsupervised learning: clustering (which involves grouping together similar data), and dimension reduction (which is a way to reduce the number of variables being considered, so that information can be found more directly).

3. Semi-supervised learning

As the name suggests, semi-supervised learning integrates both supervised and unsupervised learning. semi-supervised learning algorithms work with both unlabeled, and labeled data. 

4. Reinforcement learning 

Reinforcement learning is a process where a machine is provided with a set of tasks, rules, and parameters. The machine then tries to learn about the most optimal way to achieve sucess given a fixed set of instructions. It relies heavily on trial-and-error, and it tries to learn from past experiences in order to adapt to it's present situation. Yes, reinforcement learning is how the world's sbest chess AI was made. A reinforcement learning-based chess AI can only lose so many times before it starts to win.
